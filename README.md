# Quiz Helper
Welcome to the Quiz Helper! This is a place where you can practice quizzing and see what verses you need to work on. This is not intended as a memorizing tool, but as a review tool.

This project is currently a work in progress! Features may not work and things may look wonky.

# Important Information
Every question is in **finish the verse** format. This means that you have to submit everything that goes after the question ends, or you could just answer with the whole verse. There is also an 8 character leniency, meaning you can get a maximum of 8 **characters** incorrect.
